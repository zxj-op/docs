## Overview

In Memories.ai, all media assets and resources are scoped to a project, and projects belong to an organization. This structure allows you to manage multiple projects and collaborate with team members securely.

- **Organization**: The top-level container for all your resources. An organization can have multiple projects and members.
- **Project**: A container for your media assets, transcriptions, and processing tasks. Each project has its own set of API keys.

## Creating an Organization

When you sign up for Memories.ai, an organization is automatically created for you. You can invite team members to your organization and manage their roles and permissions from the dashboard.

## Managing Projects

You can create and manage projects from the Memories.ai Dashboard. Each project has a unique ID and its own set of API keys.

When making API requests, you need to use the API key associated with the project you want to interact with.

### Getting Project ID

You can find the project ID in the project settings page in the dashboard. This ID is sometimes required for certain API operations.

## Collaboration

Invite members to your organization to collaborate on projects. You can assign different roles to members to control their access to resources.

- **Admin**: Full access to all projects and settings within the organization.
- **Member**: Access to specific projects assigned to them.

You can manage members and their roles from the organization settings page in the dashboard.

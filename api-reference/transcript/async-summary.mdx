Her own pack considers her a jinx and treats her badly, especially her stepmother and stepsister, because they believe she brings the Wendigos to them.\n\nOne day, while being chased by a Wendigo, Kiara is rescued by Alejandro Rossi, the Alpha of the Ironclaw Pack. He takes her to his home, where she learns that he is the \"Alpha King\" who protects all the packs. Kiara is surprised because she had been told he was cold-hearted and ruthless.\n\nAlejandro keeps Kiara at his home to investigate why Wendigos are drawn to her. He discovers that she has a connection to the Moon Goddess, who tells Kiara that Alejandro is her destined mate and that their love will be tested.\n\nKiara and Alejandro develop a strong bond. He heals her wounds and helps her train to become a strong wolf. They also spend time together, going out for donuts, which Kiara had never had before.\n\nHowever, their relationship faces challenges. Alejandro has another mate, Jasmine, who is possessive and tries to hurt Kiara. The video ends with a cliffhanger, as Jasmine confronts Kiara and threatens her.",
